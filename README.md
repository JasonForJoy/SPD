## Introduction
Personas are useful for dialogue response prediction. However, the personas used in current studies are pre-defined and hard to obtain before a conversation. To tackle this issue, we study a new task, named Speaker Persona Detection (SPD), which aims to detect speaker personas based on the plain conversational text. In this task, a best-matched persona is searched out from candidates given the conversational text. This is a many-to-many semantic matching task because both contexts and personas in SPD are composed of multiple sentences. The long-term dependency and the dynamic redundancy among these sentences increase the difficulty of this task. We build a dataset for SPD, dubbed as Persona Match on Persona-Chat (PMPC). Furthermore, we evaluate several baseline models and propose utterance-to-profile (U2P) matching networks for this task. The U2P models operate at a fine granularity which treat both contexts and personas as sets of multiple sequences. Then, each sequence pair is scored and an interpretable overall score is obtained for a context-persona pair through aggregation. Evaluation results show that the U2P models outperform their baseline counterparts significantly.

## Dependencies

## Download
- Download the [BERT released by the Google research](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip), 
  and move to path: ./Pretraining-Based/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12 <br>
  
- Download the [PMPC dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sE_N7fi_WojeQBWZcTg4Mw6Pyod27S73/view?usp=sharing) used in our paper,
  and move to path: ```./data_PMPC``` <br>


## Non-Pretraining-Based Models
Train a new model.
```
cd Non-Pretraining-Based/C2P-X/scripts/
bash train.sh
```
The training process is recorded in ```log_train_*.txt``` file. <br>

Test a trained model by modifying the variable ```latest_checkpoint``` in ```test.sh```.
```
cd Non-Pretraining-Based/C2P-X/scripts/
bash test.sh
```
The testing process is recorded in ```log_test_*.txt``` file. A "output_test.txt" file which records scores for each context-persona pair will be saved to the path of ```latest_checkpoint```. Modify the variable ```test_out_filename``` in ```compute_metrics.py``` and then run the following command, various metrics will be shown.
```
python compute_metrics.py
```

You can choose a baseline model by comment/uncomment a model package (from ```model_BOW```, ```model_BiLSTM```, ```model_Transformer``` and ```model_ESIM```) in the first several lines in ```train.py```. The same process and commands can be done for those Non-Pretraining-Based U2P-X Models.


## Pretraining-Based Models
Create the fine-tuning data.
```
cd Pretraining-Based/C2P-BERT/
python data_process_tfrecord.py
```

Running the fine-tuning process.
```
cd Pretraining-Based/C2P-BERT/scripts/
bash train.sh
```

Test a trained model by modifying the variable ```restore_model_dir``` in ```test.sh```.
```
cd Pretraining-Based/C2P-BERT/scripts/
bash test.sh
```

Modify the variable ```test_out_filename``` in ```compute_metrics.py``` and then run the following command, various metrics will be shown.
```
python compute_metrics.py
```

The same process and commands can be done for U2P-BERT.

**NOTE**: Since the dataset is small, each model was trained for 10 times with identical architectures and different random initializations. Thus, we report (mean Â± standard deviation) in our paper.
